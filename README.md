# Ted Herrera — Customer Success Blueprint

I build revenue systems through Customer Success.

By combining segmentation, CSOps intelligence, and lifecycle strategy, I design operating models that reduce churn, drive expansion, and give teams real time clarity on where to act. Retention is not a reaction — it is a system. When built correctly, it scales outcomes without losing visibility or accountability.

At Best Version Media, I transformed a support function into a predictive growth engine. I built health scoring models, segmentation logic, and weekly coaching workflows that power retention and upsell strategy across a portfolio of 2500 active advertisers and six U.S. regions. These tools now guide how Sales, Market Support, and CS prioritize client outcomes and publisher performance.

My background spans SaaS, digital media, and MarTech. Across every industry, the goal remains the same — build intelligent systems that align revenue teams and make growth predictable.

## 9. Philosophy

Retention is a strategy, not a result.

Customer Success should never operate in the dark. It should surface risk before it becomes churn. It should forecast growth before it happens. And it should align every team around a shared view of where the customer is — and where they are going.

I build systems that make that happen.
